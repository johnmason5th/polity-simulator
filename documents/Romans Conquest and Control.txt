How Romans conquered and controlled land, and how and why they waged war

==Why large-scale conflict happened==
The city-states of Italy raided each other, so some city-states formed defensive alliances, such as with Rome and the Latin League.
Eventually, conquest and control emerged as a measure to fully prevent raids.

==How Rome controlled their conquered land/sphere of influence==
In the early history of the Republic, they sent citizens to own farmland in their newly conquered land, in a strategy to exert influence
